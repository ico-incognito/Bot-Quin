# Bot-Quin
The idea is to perform analysis about popularity of an apparel based on data captured from a webcam placed on a mannequin's head. The mannequin also has a mic for detecting speech.<br>
<br>
Based on data from the webcam, a person's age, gender and emotion (first impression) are recorded and stats are generated.<br>
Also the bot is able to understand the context of the person's speech.
